## General info

>In the game "Surrounded," you find yourself in the midst of a horrifying situation. The city, once a symbol of life and activity, is now plunged into chaos and fear. A zombie epidemic, like a plague, has taken over the streets, turning ordinary people into ruthless walking dead.

>You play as a survivor who remains inside this barricaded city. Supplies are dwindling, and danger escalates with each passing hour. Players must explore the city, find weapons, ammunition, and survival supplies, all while being surrounded by zombies from all sides.

>Every decision influences the course of events and your chances of survival. Will you be able to find a way out of this hellish maze, or will your story end in the clutches of the zombies?
